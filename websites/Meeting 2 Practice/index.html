        <h1>Why Environmental Awareness is important! </h1>
        
        <h3 class="contents">Environmental awareness means exactly what you may think: an awareness around the natural environment and the choices that either promote its well-being or cause it more harm. It is also the awareness that the earth is in need of protection for its survival. Along with this, the term “environmentalism” is an ideology that humans are responsible to protect and preserve the environment from human-caused afflictions. As previously stated, human-made choices are the number one reason why the planet is becoming sicker every day. Environmentalism on a large scale is one of the best ways to combat the devastating consequences of these human decisions and help the planet’s health take a complete 180 degree in the other direction. </h3>
    
    
        <h1>Major Environmental Problems </h1>
        <h3 id="EnvironmentalIsuues" class="contents">Some environmental life species require substantial areas to help provide food, living space, and other different assets. These creatures are called area specific.
        At the point when the biome is divided, the vast patches of living space don’t exist anymore. It becomes more troublesome for the wildlife to get the assets they need in order to survive. The environment goes on, even though the animals and plant life are not there to help sustain it properly. </h3>
      <h2>
        A good planet is hard to find,
        Cool kids help a warm planet,
        Dare to be a force of Nature,
        Do it for the Kids - Recycle.



      </h2>
      
      <h3 class="contents">
        Environmental Pollution means pollution which is degrading the environment. Pollution is increasing day by day and so global warming is also increasing. Due to environmental pollution, there is an imbalance in nature so many birds, animals, and plants are on the verge of extinction day by day.

        <div class="features-description"> 
          <p>A more basic cause of environmental degradation is land damage. Numerous weedy plant species, for example, garlic & mustard, are both foreign and obtrusive.
          A rupture in the environmental surroundings provides for them a chance to start growing and spreading. These plants can assume control over nature, eliminating the local greenery. The result is a territory with a solitary predominant plant which doesn’t give satisfactory food assets to all the environmental life. Thus the whole environment can be destroyed because of these invasive species.</p>

          <p>Air pollution is not good for taking healthy breathing and affects human-being at some extent.  It appears in the environment due to bad air quality. The picture is air pollution in broadly found in the urban regions rather than a rural area. Now, the affected air contains a high carbon volume that does not feel you better. Due to some human-being’s mistake and careless nature to environment protection promise you will see air pollution. It brings the health challenges related to respiratory. As you have to move from one place to another, many people drive to the vehicle to reach on the place on time. The smoke released by these transportation mediums is a major cause of air pollution. Also, deformation contributes to getting air pollution.

          <p>Water is man’s basic need for survival. Life without water is unimaginable. Water is a significant element that cannot be replaced with any other elements. Water pollution is a serious environmental issue around the world and has lead to severe implications.

            Water pollution occurs when contaminants like agricultural and toxic industrial wastes or other residues, mix in water bodies like lakes, rivers, underground water, and oceans. The contaminants dissolved in water becomes unfit for consumption. The toxic components emitted from factories make the surrounding water warm, and the atmosphere hotter as well.</p>

We need to become aware of the consequences so that we can stop plastic pollution. Kids should be taught from their childhood to avoid using plastic. Similarly, adults must check each other on the same. In addition, the government must take stringent measures to stop plastic pollution before it gets too late.</p>

    <p>Ozone layer depletion increases the amount of UVB that reaches the Earth’s surface. Laboratory and epidemiological studies demonstrate that UVB causes non-melanoma skin cancer and plays a major role in malignant melanoma development. In addition, UVB has been linked to the development of cataracts, a clouding of the eye’s lens.</p>

    <h3>COVID-19’s Economic Impact around the World  </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020, the world economy has been affected in many ways. Poorer countries have suffered the most, but, despite their greater resources, wealthier countries have faced their own challenges. This article looks at the impact of COVID-19 in different areas of the world.

      First, I put 171 nations into three groups according to per capita income: low, middle and high income. Second, I examined health statistics to show how hard-hit by the virus these nations were. Then, by comparing economic forecasts the International Monetary Fund (IMF) made in October 2019 (pre-pandemic) for 2020 with their actual values, I obtained estimates for the pandemic’s impact on growth and key economic policy variables.

    <h3>Global Warming  </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>global warming, the phenomenon of increasing average air temperatures near the surface of Earth over the past one to two centuries. Climate scientists have since the mid-20th century gathered detailed observations of various weather phenomena (such as temperatures, precipitation, and storms) and of related influences on climate (such as ocean currents and the atmosphere’s chemical composition). These data indicate that Earth’s climate has changed over almost every conceivable timescale since the beginning of geologic time and that human activities since at least the beginning of the Industrial Revolution have a growing influence over the pace and extent of present-day climate change.

    <h3>Impact on our seas</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Water pollution can be defined as the contamination of water bodies. Water pollution is caused when water bodies such as rivers, lakes, oceans, groundwater and aquifers get contaminated with industrial and agricultural effluents.

      When water gets polluted, it adversely affects all lifeforms that directly or indirectly depend on this source. The effects of water contamination can be felt for years to come.

    <p>Air pollution affects all things. It is harmful to our health, and it impacts the environment by reducing visibility and blocking sunlight, causing acid rain, and harming forests, wildlife, and agriculture. Greenhouse gas pollution, the cause of climate change, affects the entire planet.
